# Repl.it Mobile

A mobile client for the online coding platform and community [Repl.it](https://repl.it/). **This is a work in progress, [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/sVxJJZA) if you're interested!**

## Motivation

Repl.it is amazing but the site isn't very mobile friendly. It's almost impossible to select things and even write quotation marks! I want to make this much easier with a native mobile app available for iOS and Android.

## Development

- Clone this repository or pull the latest changes
- Make sure to run `yarn` to install packages
- Install the [Expo mobile app](https://expo.io/tools#client)
- Run `yarn dev` and scan the QR code
